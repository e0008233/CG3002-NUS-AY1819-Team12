## Readme For Machine Learning component

There are multiple files used over the development of the project, but the final code used in our demo is in MLP and RandomForest folders.


## Readme For files in MLP folders
Note: configure the file paths properly to link to the right folders. Run the files using Python3.

If there are warnings shown, it is safe to ignore them according to research online.


`EDA.py`: used for exploratory data analysis. 

`mlp_model.py`: used to train and do validation fo the MLP model.

`prediction.py`: used in real-time recognition to load and predict dance moves

`ProcessData.py`: used to preprocess data during real-time recognition

`ProcessDataRpi.py`: used to preprocess data for training the model

`grid_search.py`: used to find the most suitable parameters



`14_Nov1850.h5`: the trained MLP model

`14_Nov1850.sav`: the saved encoder to encode and decode multiclass labels
